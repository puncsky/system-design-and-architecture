<h1 align="center">System Design and Architecture</h1>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The 2nd Edition is still a work in progress.

The book *System Design and Architecture* has helped millions of software engineers worldwide to succeed in the Internet industry since 2015. Here is why it works:

1. üåé Real-world engineering. It comes from real-world examples of FANNG and many other silicon valley companies. And it outlines how to build real-world Internet products and services.
2. üçï Easy to digest. System design at the right level of abstraction is like a map to route you to your destination with the shortest cut. There are charts, diagrams, and step-by-step guides - all for you to acquire the minimum actionable knowledge to excel system design interviews and get started building.
3. ü§≤ Full-coverage. It strives to be "the book" for you to master most of the system design use-cases, from backend to frontend and from zero to hero.
4. üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 4-step framework. This book approaches and solve problems in a systematic and repeatable way: 1) Clarify requirements 2) Sketch out the high-level design 3) Discuss individual components and how they interact with each other 4) Wrap up with blind spots or bottlenecks.

What's different in the 2nd Edition? From 2015 to 2022, we saw mobile ate the world, cloud-native computing came across Kubernetes, and web3 went through ups and downs. There are always new companies at different stages of their lifecycles taking the lead in the Internet industry. I am interested in how they work, aren't you? So in the 2nd Edition, I will

* add more interesting content with new companies and products.
* rewrite existing content with new trends in the industry.
* add more charts and diagrams with step-by-step guides.
* add a PDF edition of the book.
* deduplicate repetitive content so that each design takes its unique abstraction.

What is out of this book's scope?

* API design for specific domains. Please go to [Google's API design guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design).
* Object-oriented design. Its importance is quite overestimated by mediocre engineers.

## How to use this book?

* For professionals (Google L5 or above), go directly to *System Design in Practice*.
* For junior and intermediate programmers (Google L3/L4), go to *System Design Theories* and then read *System Design in Practice*.
* For beginners, go to *Prepare for an Interview effectively*, then read *System Design Theories*, and finally go to *System Design in Practice*.
