abstract: "A skip-list is essentially a linked list that allows you to do a binary search on. The way it accomplishes this is by adding extra nodes that will enable you to ‘skip’ sections of the linked-list. There are LevelDB MemTable, Redis SortedSet and Lucene inverted index using this."

A skip-list is essentially a linked list that allows you to binary search on it. The way it accomplishes this is by adding extra nodes that will enable you to 'skip' sections of the linked-list. Given a random coin toss to create the extra nodes, the skip list should have O(logn) searches, inserts and deletes.

Usecases

- LevelDB MemTable
- Redis SortedSet
- Lucene inverted index
