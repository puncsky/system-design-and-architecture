![B tree vs. B+ tree](https://res.cloudinary.com/dohtidfqh/image/upload/v1566606512/web-guiguio/bMjxUqmqcmytVpJLUd9gAVEzrmGEowwQdqV4bBARLvWVRauXH_IXY01atDp4xgAnRy89RhWy9yzThAUBwIU6xWwk9gHOZT9EdXLp7rwQ3SUFwyo_4O-uUkh34vkk424x13Mlzck.png)

Pros of B tree

- Data associated with each key ⟶ frequently accessed nodes can lie closer to the root, and therefore can be accessed more quickly.

Pros of B+ tree

- No data associated in the interior nodes ⟶ more keys in memory ⟶ fewer cache misses
- Leaf nodes of B+ trees are linked ⟶ easier to traverse ⟶ fewer cache misses
