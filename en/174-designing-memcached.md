abstract: Memcached = rich client + distributed servers + hash table + LRU. It features a simple server and pushes complexity to the client) and hence reliable and easy to deploy.

## Requirements 

1. High-performance, distributed key-value store
 * Why distributed? 
   * Answer: to hold a larger size of data

     />
2. For in-memory storage of small data objects
3. Simple server (pushing complexity to the client) and hence reliable and easy to deploy

## Architecture
Big Picture: Client-server

* client
 * given a list of Memcached servers
 * chooses a server based on the key
* server
 * store KVs into the internal hash table
 * LRU eviction


The Key-value server consists of a fixed-size hash table + single-threaded handler + coarse locking

How to handle collisions? Mostly three ways to resolve:

1. Separate chaining: the collided bucket chains a list of entries with the same index, and you can always append the newly collided key-value pair to the list.
2. open addressing: if there is a collision, go to the next index until finding an available bucket.
3. dynamic resizing: resize the hash table and allocate more spaces; hence, collisions will happen less frequently.

## How does the client determine which server to query?

## How to use cache?
