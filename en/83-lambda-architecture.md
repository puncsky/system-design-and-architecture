abstract: Lambda architecture = CQRS (batch layer + serving layer) + speed layer. It solves accuracy, latency, throughput problems of big data.

## Why lambda architecture?

To solve three problems introduced by big data

1. Accuracy  (好)
2. Latency (快)
3. Throughput (多)


e.g. problems with scaling a pageview service in a traditional way

1. You start with a traditional relational database.
2. Then adding a pub-sub queue.
3. Then scaling by horizontal partitioning or sharding
4. Fault-tolerance issues begin
5. Data corruption happens

The key point is that ==X-axis dimension alone of the [AKF scale cube](41-how-to-scale-a-web-service) is not good enough. We should introduce Y-axis / functional decomposition as well. Lambda architecture tells us how to do it for a data system.==



## What is lambda architecture?

If we define a data system as

```txt
Query = function(all data)
```


Then a lambda architecture is

```txt
batch view = function(all data at the batching job's execution time)
realtime view = function(realtime view, new data)

query = function(batch view. realtime view)
```

==Lambda architecture = CQRS (batch layer + serving layer) + speed layer==
