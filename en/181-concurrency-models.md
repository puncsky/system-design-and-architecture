* Single-threaded - Callbacks, Promises, Observables and async/await: vanilla JS
* threading/multiprocessing, lock-based concurrency
    * protecting critical section vs. performance
* Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)
	* Golang or Clojureâ€™s `core.async`. 
	* process/thread passes data through channels.
* Actor Model (AM): Elixir, Erlang, Scala
	* asynchronous by nature, and have location transparency that spans runtimes and machines - if you have a reference (Akka) or PID (Erlang) of an actor, you can message it via mailboxes.
	* powerful fault tolerance by organizing actors into a supervision hierarchy, and you can handle failures at its exact level of hierarchy.
* Software Transactional Memory (STM): Clojure, Haskell
	* like MVCC or pure functions: commit / abort / retry
