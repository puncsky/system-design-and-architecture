AKF scale cube visualizes the scaling process into three dimensions…

1. ==Horizontal Duplication== and Cloning (X-Axis). Having a farm of identical and preferably stateless instances behind a load balancer or reverse proxy. Therefore, every request can be served by any of those hosts and there will be no single point of failure.
2. ==Functional Decomposition== and Segmentation - Microservices  (Y-Axis). e.g. auth service, user profile service, photo service, etc
3. ==Horizontal Data Partitioning== - Shards (Z-Axis).  Replicate the whole stack to different “pods”.  Each pod can target a specific large group of users. For example, Uber had China and US data centers. Each datacenter might have different “pods” for different regions.
