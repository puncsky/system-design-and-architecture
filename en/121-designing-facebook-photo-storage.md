## Motivation & Assumptions

* PB-level Blob storage
* Traditional NFS based desgin (Each image stored as a file) has metadata bottleneck: large metadata size severely limits the metadata hit ratio.
	* Explain more about the metadata overhead

> For the Photos application most of this metadata, such as permissions, is unused and thereby wastes storage capacity. Yet the more significant cost is that the fileâ€™s metadata must be read from disk into memory in order to find the file itself. While insignificant on a small scale, multiplied over billions of photos and petabytes of data, accessing metadata is the throughput bottleneck.



## Solution

Eliminates the metadata overhead by aggregating hundreds of thousands of images in a single haystack store file.



## Architecture

## Data Layout

index file (for quick memory load) + haystack store file containing needles.

### CRUD Operations

* Create: write to store file and then ==async== write index file, because index is not critical
* Read: read(offset, key, alternate_key, cookie, data_size)
* Update: Append only. If the app meets duplicate keys, then it can choose one with largest offset to update.
* Delete: soft delete by marking the deleted bit in the flag field. Hard delete is executed by the compact operation.
